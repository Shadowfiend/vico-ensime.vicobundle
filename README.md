Vico-ENSIME
================================

This bundle is meant to provide interactions between Vico and the ENSIME
server. ENSIME is designed for essentially adding Scala support to emacs;
however, it is built as a generic server. We interface with it, and, thanks to
Nu, can speak Lisp to it fairly easily.

Note that this bundle currently requires a patch allowing socket access via
ViBufferedStream that is only fully merged in the merge branch of my Vico fork,
at http://github.com/Shadowfiend/vico/tree/merged .
